/**
 * aoi learn — stub implementation (#521).
 *
 * Migration scaffold for Oracle skill /learn. Real flow (parallel Haiku
 * agents, ghq clone, symlink into ψ/learn/<owner>/<repo>/origin, date/time
 * folder layout, .origins manifest, hub file) is tracked as follow-up work.
 *
 * Until that lands, this stub:
 *   - Accepts <repo> + mode (default | fast | deep)
 *   - Returns a well-shaped stub message with the selected mode
 *   - Points users at the Oracle skill for actual learning runs
 *
 * The function is pure (no I/O, no process spawning) so it's safe to unit
 * test and safe to wire into the CLI ahead of the real impl.
